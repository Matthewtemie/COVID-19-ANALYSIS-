## Project Setup

* Ensure that you have a working SQL database management system (DBMS) installed, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

* Download the COVID-19 dataset in a compatible format, such as a CSV or SQL file.

* Import the dataset into your DBMS or create the necessary tables manually.

* Connect to your database using your preferred SQL client or command line interface.

## Data Schema

*province: province or state where the case was reported

*confirmed: number of confirmed cases

*deaths: number of deaths

*recovered: number of recoveries

Ensure that the tables are properly indexed for optimal query performance.
